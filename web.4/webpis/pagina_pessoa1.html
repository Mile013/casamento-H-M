            <p>Susana Kissoon,<br><br>
                Who would've thought that a friendship that started at work would turn into this?
You've seen every side of me — from my messy, tearful moments to my wild, "let's dance till 4 AM" phases. From a kid chasing dreams to the woman standing here today (still chasing dreams... just with better shoes).
You were right there for one of the biggest moments of my life in Canada — when I got married — and you’ve held me up during some of the toughest times too.
You didn’t just welcome me into your life, you and your family made me one of your own — with so much love, advice, and support that helped me grow in ways I can't even put into words (but here I am, trying anyway).

We've shared ridiculous amounts of laughs, concerts that made us lose our voices, laughs that made our abs sore (free workout), and survived the kind of parties that deserve their own Netflix special.

Now, after 7 years of friendship, I honestly can’t imagine this next chapter without you.
With my family there, and as we receive God's blessing, I would be over the moon to have you standing by my side.

So Susana… would you do me the honor of being my bridesmaid and making this crazy special day even more unforgettable?
(You already know the afterparty is going to be legendary.)
