                Can you believe it all started with nostril swabbing at work?! 😂 Who knew one COVID stick up the nose would lead to one special friendships?

You, the woman who can cure a headache with nothing but a blast of house music 🎶💃 (honestly, I think it’s a legit medical breakthrough). You've opened your home and your heart to me when I needed it most, and I’ll never forget that. From that wild, dreamy trip to Mexico 🌮🍹 to conquering mountains on hikes (okay, maybe just mildly steep hills, but still 😅), every moment with you has been full of laughs, learning, and inspiration.

Your way of seeing life is something I truly admire. Even when you couldn't physically be there, you were virtually present during one of the biggest moments of my life—and now, I want you standing right beside me for the next one!

So… will you do me the absolute honor of being my bridesmaid? 👗✨

I need your fun, your dance moves, your amazing energy, and your full-on Donna-ness next to me, surrounded by my family and friends on the most magical day of my life.
