            <p>HIRRRRAAAAAA 🧛‍♀️❄️ aka Vampire Ice Queen!,<br><br>
                Can you actually believe it’s been 8 YEARS?! Like what even is time?? One minute we were babies (well, I was a baby — you were already ancient and wise LOL) and now… I’m getting married. MARRIED. Could you ever imagine?! Like EVER?! 😂 (yes you could cuz I already am🌝).

From not knowing how to use a calculator (don’t judge me) to becoming fully indoctrinated into the cult of K-Dramas and K-Pop — all thanks to you — our journey has been full of chaos, comfort, and iconic moments.

You were there for me when I was the confused new kid with zero clue, and you’ve been there every step of the way since, even at my most important moment here: my engagement and marriage. And now… I want you to be there again — but this time, right next to me as my BRIDESMAID! 💃💐

So what do you say, my ice queen? Will you accept this noble mission, use your vampire powers and secret karate moves 🥋 to protect me from any wedding drama, and bring your effortlessly cool presence to the big day?

It wouldn’t be the same without you. Your presence would mean the world to me — and you know In case I need need backup. 😜
